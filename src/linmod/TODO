== Library ==
* Use lm_fit in glm_fit (instead of dgels); return residuals, etc.
* Handle m < n case in lm_fit.


== Misc library crap ==
* Expand the C interface.
* Finish the transposers.
* Documentation


== "eventually" == 
Expand families/links to full R support:
  * Binomial: cloglog, log, logit (DONE), probit, cauchit
  * Gamma: identity, inverse, log (DONE)
  * Gaussian: identity, inverse, log (DONE)
  * Poisson: identity, log, sqrt (DONE)
  
  * Inverse gamma: inverse, log, identity, "1/mu^2"
  * Quasi-Binomial: logit, probit, clogloc, cauchit, log
  * Quasi-Poisson: log, identity, sqrt
