== Library ==
* Use lm_fit in glm_fit (instead of dgels); return effects, residuals, etc.
* Handle m < n case in lm_fit.
* Compute deviance residuals in glm.


== Misc library crap ==
* Expand the C interface.
* Documentation.


== "eventually" == 
Expand families/links to full R support:
  * Binomial: cloglog, log, logit, probit, cauchit (DONE)
  * Gamma: identity, inverse, log (DONE)
  * Gaussian: identity, inverse, log (DONE)
  * Poisson: identity, log, sqrt (DONE)
  * Inverse gaussian: inverse, log, identity, "1/mu^2" (DONE)
  
  * Quasi-Binomial: logit, probit, clogloc, cauchit, log
  * Quasi-Poisson: log, identity, sqrt
